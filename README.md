## Notes on use:  
```
1. The race info and wager info boxes will disappear if text box is left blank when updating match info.
   (behavior is by design. if you wish to have the panels display empty,
   type "&nbsp;" (without the quotes) in the text box.)
2. The shot clock will auto display in the stream starting at 10s remaining.
3. Once a player strokes the ball click Stop Clock and then start a new 30s timer for the next shot or
   the incoming player when the cue ball fully stops moving.
4. Audible alerts will sound starting at 5s remaining. 
   (these only play locally unless picked up by microphone).
5. Players get 1 30s extension per rack. if accidently clicked you can use the P1/P2 ext reset buttons. 
6. When a player score is recorded the shot clock will stop and the player extensions are reset. 
7. Clock will display in the control_panel in obs when Shot clock is started. 
```	
---------------------------------------------------------------


## Shot Clock
If you are not familiar with the use of a shot clock in pool.
```
A shot clock is used in most professional 9 ball tournaments. shot clock play is as follows:

	1. first shot after break is a 60s shot. 
	2. if player elects to "push" the incoming player gets 60s. 
	   if player chooses to give it back to the original shooter, 
	   then that shot it is a 30s shot. 
	3. all shots thereafter are 30s shots.
	4. shot clock starts when cue ball has stopped moving.
	   and stops when player contacts cue ball with stick. 
	5. each player/team gets 1 30s extension per rack. 
	   which must be called before time expires.
