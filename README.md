# PoolStat Scoreboard for OBS

PoolStat Scoreboard is a plugin for ![OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) that connects your ![PoolStat.net.au](https://poolstat.net.au) live scores directly to your OBS broadcast rig.  
Through a dedicated Live Stream Portal, it links active PoolStat matches with your on-premise broadcast setup, effectively turning it into a remotely controlled production hub.

The plugin overlays fully customizable graphics on your camera feed and streams the result straight to your preferred platform, including Facebook, YouTube, and Twitch.

When a player updates a score in PoolStat, the change is sent to OBS almost instantly, ensuring your scoreboard is always up to date during the live stream.
